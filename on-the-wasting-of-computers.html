            It was 2021 when Microsoft released the next major revision of the ubiquitous Windows operating system, and along with it came the usual requirement for users to have newer hardware to upgrade. This time around, computers older than 2018 were destined for their end of life just 3 short years after they came to exist; fast foward to today and the holdouts who still run Windows 10 are now facing retribution with Microsoft's final warning before this October when they leave those computers in the dust, unsecured against viruses and exploits <a class="ref" href="#ref-1">[1]</a>. Because of this, it's likely that an astronomically large number of electronics are to be thrown away rather than reused for the years to come, which brings to light 2 major ongoing issues: 1) the creation of electronic waste, and 2) the need for people to regularly purchase expensive machines.

            Some might disregard the second point on the basis that people don't want to use old devices; after all, anyone who's been stuck with a 5 to 10 year old laptop would know that they're typically quite slow, oftentimes glitchy, and more often than not there are some applications which just refuse to run on dated computers--an issue that is especially prevalent in those small mobile computers we call phones. But what if computers didn't have to degrade like this with age? Is it possible to make a computer run effectively through a lifetime of, say, over 10 years? And if so, what are the implications?
        </p>

        <p>
            In order to determine the practicality of longer-lasting devices, one must question the reason why they degrade in the first place. Part of the issue is that hardware simply falls apart; given enough time, monitors can develop dead pixels and a off-white tint, hard drives can malfunction and effectively self-destruct, batteries lose their ability to hold a charge. On the other hand, monitors have improved with time and rarely defect, advancements in SSD hard drive technology has notably reduced the chance of failure, and batteries are simple to replace for a low price, not to mention the laptop I've designed this website on and wrote this post with is 9 years old and still going without ever having upgrades nor repairs. Hell, the battery is still able to hold a charge for a good 5 hours of active use!

            Notwithstanding intermittant and occasional manufacturing defects and faulty components that require maintanence and repairs, the physical limitations of hardware isn't what prevents computers from a 10-year or longer lifecycle; thus the problem must lie somewhere within the software. As a result of this finding, it's easy to blame innovation as the root cause; it's easy to say that the next big thing needs more powerful machines, that modern expectations for computers necessitate power-hungry AI applications and whatnot, and that old devices just wont make the cut.
        </p>

            There is a degree of truth to these statements; for reference, the 2005 Nintendo DS gaming console had a clock speed of 33 megahertz (meaning it can run about 33 million operations per second depending how you count), while an average laptop these days can reach into the thousands of megahertz. Go back a bit further to the 1980's and you might find, just as long-time programmer James Hague did in his 2008 post on the matter, that something like a simple spellchecker could take someone months to create due to the dedication required to make it fast enough to run in a reasonable amount of time, whereas these days a spellchecker could be made in a matter of minutes by a programmer with a bit of insight <a class="ref" href="#ref-2">[2]</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            The point is, there has been a long-standing trend of advancements in computer technology which will likely continue for time to come. It's realistic to think that the technology of today may very well be obsolete compared to hardware available a decade from now. From that, it's possible to conclude that in the future, the computers we have now will not satisfy the needs of users and thus we will all require new ones sooner or later.
        </p>

        <p>
            The issue that lies in these comparisons is that they are relative. Consider an absolute perspective: if the computers of today can adequately fulfill the needs of those who use them, then surely they would be capable of fulfilling those same needs in a year, or two years, or five years, and so on and so forth until the device eventually accumulates a decade and change's worth of physical wear and tear to the point it no longer functions. In other words, the existence of faster computers doesn't make standard computers worse than they are now, or at least it wouldn't make much sense if it did...

            In practice, I think many including myself can attest to the fact that machines <em>do</em> tend to slow down with time; an iPhone, for example, is hardly usable beyond texting after 6 or so years; apps will take an eternity to load compared to the day the phone was bought, and good luck loading a large website before the connection times out. So what gives?

            Perhaps a trip through time will shed some light on the issue. Above is a screenshot of a Windows 11 home screen, courtesy of Wikipedia and Microsoft. It's quite empty really; a web browser in the corner, standard office tools installed, an app store, system utilities. Throw in some games and professional software and I think that covers most of what laptops and desktops are generally used for.

            Windows 8. Remarkably similar to its successors, and yet it takes just a quarter of the memory and storage to install in comparison.
        </p>

        <div class="image-holder">
            <img src="windows-xp.png" alt="Windows XP start screen">

            2001: the introduction of Windows XP. A mere 64 MiB of RAM can get this system up and running--less than 1.6% of the memory required to boot up Windows 11. As for storage, XP only needs 1.5 GB, under 2.4% of what Windows 11 mandates.

        </p>

        <p>
            The color scheme may look less appealing a couple decades after the fact, but that's nothing that a designer couldn't have fixed up. The real question is if 24 years ago a desktop homescreen required such a comparatively small amount of computing resources, what is all of that extra hardware, extra memory, extra storage being used for in Windows 11's homescreen?
        </p>

        <p>
            Some of it can be chalked up to new features; it's not like Copilot existed back in the era of Windows XP, but then again most of the energy used by that kind of AI is done on servers rather than personal machines. It can be argued that smoother animations contribute to the huge jump in resource usage, but disabling animations only results in a small improvement.

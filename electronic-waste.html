            It was 2021 when Microsoft released the next major revision of the ubiquitous Windows operating system, and along with it came the usual requirement for users to have newer hardware to upgrade. This time around, computers older than 2018 were destined for their end of life just 3 short years after they came to exist; fast foward to today and the holdouts who still run Windows 10 are now facing retribution with Microsoft's final warning before they leave those computers in the dust, unsecured against viruses and exploits. Along with their warning is a 3 item checklist for outdated computers: 1) save your information, 2) erase the computer, and 3) throw the computer away (responsibly, of course)<a class="ref" href="#ref-1">[1]</a>. Situations like these beg the question: what are the implications of optimizing computers for longevity?

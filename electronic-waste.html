        <p>
            It was 2021 when Microsoft released the next major revision of the ubiquitous Windows operating system, and along with it came the usual requirement for users to have newer hardware to upgrade. This time around, computers older than 2018 were destined for their end of life just 3 short years after they came to exist; fast foward to today and the holdouts who still run Windows 10 are now facing retribution with Microsoft's final warning before this October when they leave those computers in the dust, unsecured against viruses and exploits <a class="ref" href="#ref-1">[1]</a>. Because of this, it's likely that a astronomically large number of computers are to be thrown away rather than reused for the years to come, presenting 2 major issues: 1) the creation of electronic waste, and 2) the need for people to regularly purchase new, expensive computers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some might disregard the second point on the basis that people don't want to use old computers; after all, anyone who's been stuck with a 5-10 year old laptop would know that they're typically quite slow, oftentimes glitchy, and more often than not there are some applications which just refuse to run on dated computers. But what if computers didn't have to degrade like this with age? Is it possible to make a computer run effectively through a lifetime of over 10 years, and if so, what are the implications?
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to determine the practicality of long-lasting computers, one must question the reason computers degrade at all. Part of the issue is that hardware simply falls apart; given enough time, monitors can develop dead pixels and a off-white tint, hard drives can malfunction and destroy themselves, batteries lose their ability to hold a charge. On the other hand, monitors have improved with time and rarely defect, advancements in SSD hard drive technology has notably reduced the chance of failure, and batteries are simple to replace for a low price, not to mention the laptop I've designed this website on and wrote this post with is 9 years old and still going without ever having hardware upgrades nor repairs. Hell, the battery is still able to hold a charge for a good 5 hours of active use!

        <p>
            If hardware defects aren't what prevents computers from a 10-year or longer lifecycle, then intuitively the problem must lie somewhere within the software. It's easy to blame it on innovation, it's easy to say that the next big thing needs more powerful devices, that the modern realization of computers necessitates power-hungry AI applications and whatnot, and that old computers just wont make the cut.
<!--             There is a degree of truth to these statements; hardware has indeed improved in the orders of magnitude in just the last two decades. -->
        </p>
        <p>
            For reference, the 2005 Nintendo DS gaming console had a clock speed of 33 megahertz (meaning it can run about 33 million operations per second), while an average laptop these days can reach into the thousands of megahertz. Go back a bit further to the 1980's and you might find, just as programmer James Hague did in his 2008 post on the matter, that a simple spellchecker could take someone months to create due to the dedication required to make it fast enough to run in a reasonable amount of time, whereas these days a spellchecker could be made in a matter of minutes by a programmer with a bit of insight <a class="ref" href="#ref-2">[2]</a>. Point is, computers absolutely improve with time. The question is, must they?...

            what are the implications of optimizing computers for longevity?

            some may say it has benefits: innovation
